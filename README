export CC=gcc FC=gfortran
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release [-DOPENMP=1] [-DARCH=<arch>]

OpenMP is off by default.

<arch> is the argument for gcc -march=<arch>, icc -x<arch> and so on.
Usefull options for gcc 4.7 are currently bdver1 for Interlagos and
corei7-avx for Xeons with AVX.

If <arch> is specified, the executable will be qgibbs.<arch>
